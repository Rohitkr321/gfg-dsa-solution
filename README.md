# GeeksforGeeks DSA Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a topic in DSA, for example:
  - `Arrays/` â€“ Problems related to arrays
  - `Strings/` â€“ Problems related to strings
  - `LinkedList/` â€“ Linked List problems
  - `DynamicProgramming/` â€“ DP problems
- Each file contains the solution for a particular problem, named appropriately.

## âš¡ Problem Solving

- Problems are solved in **C++**.
- Solutions are tested on multiple test cases for correctness.
- Each file is self-contained and can be compiled directly using `g++`.

Example to compile and run a program:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
